Customer churn retention is the process of reducing the number of customers who stop using a company's products or services. It involves understanding the reasons why customers leave and implementing strategies to encourage them to stay. Retention efforts typically focus on building strong customer relationships, improving the overall customer experience, and providing incentives to keep customers engaged. By prioritizing retention, businesses can increase customer lifetime value, reduce acquisition costs, and ultimately boost revenue and profitability.
